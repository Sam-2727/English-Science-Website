## Here's how:
1. Draft a letter to your senator/representative
2. Show up at town halls. Bring Signs!
3. Call your senator/represenative's office
4. Participate actively in the election process. Show up at candidate debates, ask questions of candidates, make sure supporting science is a priority high on their radar.

# How to draft a letter
Here are some things you should include in any letter you send.
1. Clearly articulate your proposal. Don't be vague: cut straight to the point.
2. The material impact of your proposal. Members of congress are elected, and must justify any proposal they have with its material impact.
3. Make your letter formal. This will make your letter be taken more seriously.
4. Contact us to get custom templates, based on party affiliation.
